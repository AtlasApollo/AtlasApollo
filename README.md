# 👋 Hi, I'm Mike Gurevich

I'm a senior full-stack engineer and AI-augmented product builder who delivers fast, enterprise-grade systems with emotional intelligence and clear communication. I specialize in building expressive platforms that combine solid architecture, intelligent automation, and meaningful user experiences.

Over the past 25+ years, I’ve led projects from concept to scale, blending sharp technical execution with human-centered thinking. I turn complexity into clarity — and vision into working software.

I bridge cutting-edge AI with robust engineering to deliver platforms that are fast to market, built to scale, and designed for real-world impact — whether solo-building, leading teams, or driving strategy across functions.

### 🔧 What I'm Building

- **[Satisph.ai](https://www.satisphai.com)** – AI-first platform for interactive, character-driven interviews:  
  A modular system that powers intelligent conversations across domains like resumes, dating, introspection, and beyond.  
  Users engage with AI "teams" made of specialized characters, each with distinct roles and memory, orchestrated via **LangChain** and **LangGraph**.

  ✅ Features:
  - Multi-agent orchestration with contextual memory  
  - PDF ingestion, parsing, and vector embedding pipelines  
  - Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for dynamic, accurate Q&A  
  - Fast, pluggable architecture for supporting custom domains and user-created interview teams  
  - Background task queues with **Celery** and **Redis**  
  - Persistent session tracking and rich analytics with **PostgreSQL** + **pgvector**

  🎨 Frontend (in development):  
  - Built with **React**, **Next.js**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **shadcn/ui**  
  - Clean, extensible UI framework designed for expressive character chat, onboarding flows, and future visualizations  
  - Fully responsive and optimized for rapid iteration

  The result: a flexible, AI-powered platform that helps people be seen, understood, and supported — whether they're applying for jobs, exploring themselves, or just having conversations that matter.


- **[ILYS.com](https://ilys.com)** – Radical writing platform for focused flow:  
  A unique, distraction-free writing experience where users can only see one letter at a time — designed to silence the inner critic and unlock pure creative output.  
  Live since 2011 and still growing, ILYS is a production-grade, full-stack Laravel application built and maintained entirely in-house.

  ✅ Backend Architecture:
  - Framework: **Laravel 11** with **Inertia.js**, **Jetstream**, **Sanctum**, and **Spark** for auth, sessions, and Stripe billing
  - Admin tooling: **Nova** for powerful content and subscription management  
  - Queues & background jobs: **Horizon** + **Redis**  
  - File handling: **Spatie MediaLibrary Pro**, Dropbox SDK integration  
  - AI integration: **OpenAI PHP SDK**, token-based cleanup system  
  - Email: **Spatie Mailcoach**, **Mailgun**  
  - Security: Implements OWASP best practices, Debugbar, Query Detector, automated backups via **Spatie Backup**

  ✅ Frontend & UX:
  - SPA-style experience with **Vue 3**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Vite**
  - Real-time writing flow with dynamic word count goals and session architecture
  - Intuitive dashboard with subscription management, settings, and writing session history

  ✅ Infrastructure:
  - Containerized via **Laravel Sail** (`docker-compose`), including services for **MySQL**, **Redis**, and **Mailhog**
  - Deployment-ready for scalable cloud infrastructure (AWS EC2, S3, Nginx)

  ILYS combines production-grade SaaS architecture with an unusually intimate and expressive user experience. It's both a technical system and a creative sanctuary — serving thousands of writers over the past decade.


- **BoomBoom Networks** – Creator  
  Fully automated media pipelines that convert news and astrology data into generative songs, poems, and videos using `n8n`, `GPT-4`, `Udio`, and `FFmpeg`. Designed for modular expansion and viral content creation.
